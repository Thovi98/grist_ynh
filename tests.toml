    # ------------
    # Tests to run
    # ------------

    # NB: the tests to run are automatically deduced by the CI script according to the
    # content of the app's manifest. The declarations below allow to customize which
    # tests are ran, possibly add special test suite to test special args, or
    # declare which commits to test upgrade from.
    #
    # You can also decide (though this is discouraged!) to ban/ignore some tests,

    exclude = ["install.subdir", "install.nourl"]
    # The test IDs to be used in only/exclude statements are:
    # * install.root
    # * install.subdir
    # * install.nourl
    # * install.multi
    # * backup_restore
    # * upgrade
    # * upgrade.someCommitId
    # * change_url
    # NB: you should NOT need this except if you really have a good reason...

    # -------------------------------
    # Default args to use for install
    # -------------------------------

    # By default, the CI will automagically fill the 'standard' args
    # such as domain, path, admin, is_public and password with relevant values
    # and also install args with a "default" provided in the manifest..
    # It should only make sense to declare custom args here for args with no default values

    args.language = "fr"
    # NB: you should NOT need those lines unless for custom questions with no obvious/default value

# This is an additional test suite
[some_additional_testsuite]

    # On additional tests suites, you can decide to run only specific tests

    only = ["install.subdir"]

    args.language = "en"
